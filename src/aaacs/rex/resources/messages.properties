# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# All properties are REQUIRED unless clearly marked otherwise!

# Note: this needs to be cleaned up. From an abstract perspective, it seems that
# errors can and should be classified in at least two dimensions simultaneously:
# the layer or component the error occurred, and the type/cause of error. Other
# dimensions? There is most definitely available literature on error management.
