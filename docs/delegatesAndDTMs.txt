- page fills in bean values
- submit calls a method
	- method generates ActionRequest
- method returns a string indicating outcome PLUS data
- correct page response is picked out
	- data is used to fill it in

	
Issues

Delegate
DTO
Dispatcher


Delegate:
	- each one has a Session Bean analogue on the Core Server
	- methods that invoke coreserver analogues
DTM (Data Transfer Map)
	- supports multiple objects of intended type but with String properties
	- can translate DTM's to Maps/Lists/arrays of native objects, as well as native objects
	- can validate properties of any object in its Map
	- each one needs to be added to faces-config.xml as a backing bean
